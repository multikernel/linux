	help
	  A simple read-only filesystem stored in shared physical memory.
	  It can be backed by any dma-buf (e.g. system heap, CMA heap,
	  or the multikernel memory pool) or by a raw phys/size region.

	  The host writes a daxfs image into the buffer, then mounts it
	  by passing the dma-buf fd via fsconfig(FSCONFIG_SET_FD).

	  If unsure, say N.
